## WHAT IS WEB SCRAPING
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Some data that is available on the web is presented in a format that makes it easier to collect and use it. web scraping uses intelligent automation to retrieve hundreds, millions, or even billions of data points from the internet’s seemingly endless frontier.More than a modern convenience, the true power of web scraping lies in its ability to build and power some of the world’s most revolutionary business applications. 
#### it works by two parts:
###### the crawler
A web crawler, which we generally call a “spider,” is an artificial intelligence that browses the internet to index and search for content by following links and exploring, like a person with too much time on their hands.
###### the scraper
A web scraper is a specialized tool designed to accurately and quickly extract data from a web page. Web scrapers vary widely in design and complexity, depending on the project.
## THE WEB SCRAPING PROCESS
#### first step
our team of seasoned scraping veterans develops a scraper unique to your project, designed specifically to target and extract the data you want from the websites you want it from.
#### second step
The data is retrieved in HTML format, after which it is carefully parsed to extricate the raw data you want from the noise surrounding it. Depending on the project, the data can be as simple as a name and address in some cases, and as complex as high dimensional weather and seed germination data the next.
#### third step
Ultimately, the data is stored in the format and to the exact specifications of the project. Some companies use third party applications or databases to view and manipulate the data to their choosing, while others prefer it in a simple, raw format - generally as CWHSV, TSV or JSON.
